  <option name="DESCRIPTION" value="fix (MatchEndpoint) restore support for 'forAccountId' / 'forPlatformId' at gettingById() Since RIOT's stance on normal games data changed, these options are not  required anymore to get unobfuscated player information for normal games.  They now can be used as a pre-select so to speak, to only return the player  information for the specified player, if available, restoring the behaviour from before RIOT's revert" />
